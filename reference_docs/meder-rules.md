## <span id="#INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</span>

The Laws of Chess cannot cover all possible situations that may arise
during a game, nor can they regulate all administrative questions. Where
cases are not precisely regulated by an Article of the Laws, it should
be possible to reach a correct decision by studying analogous situations
which are discussed in the Laws.

The Laws assume that arbiters have the necessary competence, sound
judgement and absolute objectivity. Too detailed a rule might deprive
the arbiter of his freedom of judgement and thus prevent him from
finding the solution to a problem dictated by fairness, logic and
special factors.

In these Laws the words 'he', 'him' and 'his' include 'she' and 'her'.

Three-dimensional chess is an extremely beautiful and logical game,
known and respected from one edge of the galaxy to another. From Cestus
III to the planet Vulcan, from Sol III to the very heart of the Klingon
Empire, it is played by numerous forms of intelligent life and honored
for its cool logic. However, the basic form of this game is to be found
on 20th century Earth, where it was developed from "normal",
two-dimensional chess. Nevertheless the Romulans say: "You haven't
experienced three-dimensional chess until you read the rules in original
Romulan."

 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span id="RULES"></span>

Article 1: The nature and objectives of three-dimensional chess

1.1 Three-dimensional chess is played between two opponents who move
pieces or attack boards alternately on a game set called a
'3D-Chessboard'. The player with the white pieces commences the game. A
player is said to 'have the move', when his opponent's move has been
completed.

1.2 The objective of each player is to place the opponent's king 'under
attack' in such a way that the opponent has no legal move which would
avoid the 'capture' of the king on the following move. The player who
achieves this is said to have 'checkmated' the opponent and to have won
the game. The opponent who has been checkmated has lost the game.

1.3 If the position is such that neither player can possibly checkmate,
the game is drawn.

 

Article 2: The initial position of the pieces on the 3D-Chessboard

2.1 The 3D-Chessboard is composed of 3 main boards and 4 movable attack
boards.

2.2 A main board is composed of a 4x4 grid of 16 equal squares
alternately clear (the 'white' squares) and coloured (the 'black'
squares).

2.3 An attack board is composed of a 2x2 grid of 4 squares.

2.4 By looking at the 3D-Chessboard from the top, the 3 main boards form
one board, 8 squares long and 4 squares wide. The lower-most board is
termed "White's Board (W)", the middle board is the "Neutral Board (N)"
and the top board is "Black's Board (B)".

2.5 The attack boards start the game on the rear pins of the White and
Black Boards, and are referred to as "Queen's Level (QL)" and "King's
Level (KL)" depending on which side of the board they are located.

<img src="image2.gif" data-hspace="1" width="395" height="420" />
<img src="image3.gif" data-hspace="1" width="240" height="426" />

<img src="image4.gif" data-hspace="1" width="373" height="241" />

2.6 At the beginning of the game one player has 16 light-coloured pieces
(the 'white' pieces) and 2 'white' attack boards; the other has 16
dark-coloured pieces (the 'black' pieces) and 2 marked ('black') attack
boards.  
The pieces are as follows:  
a white king, a white queen, two white rooks, two white bishops, two
white knights, eight white pawns;  
a black king, a black queen, two black rooks, two black bishops, two
black knights, eight black pawns.

2.7 The initial position of the pieces on the chessboard is as
follows:  

<img src="image5.gif" data-align="LEFT" data-hspace="9" width="352"
height="395" />

2.8 By looking from the top: The vertical columns of squares are called
'files' (z, a, b, c, d, e). The ten horizontal rows of squares are
called 'ranks'. A straight line of squares of the same colour, touching
corner to corner, is called a 'diagonal'.  
Due to the attack boards a 3D-Chessboard has a very individual shape,
which may vary. Consequently, there are squares which are part-time or
permanently (e.g. b0) non-existent. Also, non-existent squares are part
of 'files', 'ranks' and 'diagonals'.

 

Article 3: The moves of the pieces and of the attack boards

<tr>
<td data-valign="TOP">3.1</td>
<td>(a) Any move which can be made in a standard chess game (i.e. flat
board), can be made in three-dimensional chess. Since every overlapping
square is the same colour, you have the option of deciding which level
you wish a piece to land on. For this reason two pieces of the same (or
different) colours can occupy the same square (on different
levels).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>(b) No piece can be moved to a square (on the same level) occupied
by a piece of the same colour. If a piece moves to a square occupied by
an opponent's piece the latter is captured and removed from the
chessboard as part of the same move. A piece is said to attack a square
if the piece could make a capture on that square according to Articles
3.2 to 3.5. A piece is considered to attack a square, even if such a
piece is constrained from moving to that square because it would then
leave or place the king of its own colour under attack (compare Article
3.5(b)).<br />
(c) A piece, on any individual square, blocks the abiltiy of other
pieces to move at all levels (according to Article 3.1(a) and 3.2 to
3.5), except for the knight which can jump over any intervening pieces. 
But the moving piece may land above or below the occupied square
and continue its move on the next turn.<br />
(d) Vertical moves without horizontal movement of a piece are forbidden.
I.e., a piece cannot move to the same square on another level.<br />
(e) A move which ends on a non-existent square is forbidden. (See
Article 2.8)</td>

stands.<br />
(c) The bishop moves to any square along a diagonal on which it
stands.<br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

When making these moves the queen, rook or bishop cannot move over any
intervening pieces. (See Article 3.1(c))

3.3 The knight moves to one of the squares nearest to that on which it
stands but not on the same rank, file or diagonal. It does not pass
directly over any intervening square.

<td>(a) The pawn moves forward to the unoccupied square immediately in
front of it on the same file, or<br />
(b) on its first move the pawn may advance two squares along the same
file provided both squares are unoccupied (a pawn which has been moved
by the move of an attack board (see Article 3.6) is NO LONGER allowed to
move two squares) , or<br />
(c) the pawn moves to a square occupied by an opponent's piece which is
diagonally in front of it on an adjacent file, capturing that
piece.<br />
(d) A pawn attacking a square crossed by an opponent's pawn which has
advanced two squares in one move from its original square may capture
this opponent's pawn as though the latter had been moved only one
square. This capture can be made only on the move following this advance
and is called an 'en passant' capture. According to Article 3.1(a) you
have the option of deciding which level you wish the pawn to land on. A
pawn which has been moved by the move of an attack board (see Article
3.6) cannot be captured 'en passant'.<br />
(e) (i) When a pawn reaches the rank furthest from its starting position
it must be exchanged as part of the same move for a queen, rook, bishop
or knight of the same colour. The player's choice is not restricted to
pieces that have been captured previously. This exchange of a pawn for
another piece is called 'promotion' and the effect of the new piece is
immediate.<br />
(ii) Which rank is considered 'furthest' depends on the specific
situation during the game. For files b and c, rank 1 (or 8) would be
considered 'furthest'. For files z and e, rank 0 (or 9) would always be
'furthest'. For files a and d, the furthest rank varies depending on
whether an attack board overhanging the corner is present. If present,
the furthest rank is 0 (or 9). If not present, the furthest rank is 1
(or 8).<br />
(iii) A special situation comes up, if a white pawn is located on a8B or
d8B (or a black pawn on a1W / d1W) and is not 'promoted', because an
attack board is overhanging the corner. If the attack board later on
leaves that corner, the pawn must be 'promoted' before the next move is
initiated.(This implies that such an attack board move is prevented
temporarily, if this move would place the king of its own colour under
attack - see Article 3.5(b).)</td>

<blockquote>
(i) moving to any adjoining square that is not attacked by one or more
of the opponent's pieces,

(ii) 'castling'. This is a move of the king and either rook of the same
colour on the same rank, counting as a single move of the king and
executed as follows:<br />
To castle on the king's side: The king exchances its place with the
rook.<br />
To castle on the queens's side: The king is transferred from its
original square to the square beside the rook, then that rook is
transferred to the square the king has vacated.<br />

<td data-valign="TOP">3.6 An attack board can only be moved, if it holds
no more than one piece (regardless which piece that is). Attack boards
are controlled by the player whose piece is located on it. Empty attack
boards are the property of the original owner (marking).<br />
The movement of an attack board is similar to the move of a rook. The
distance is any adjacent pin. "Adjacent" means the next pins of the same
or the next main board. (Levels 1 &amp; 6 have three, levels 2 &amp; 5
have four, and levels 3 &amp; 4 have five adjacent pins.) Also, only
empty attack boards can be moved to an inverted (i.e. backward) pin
position. Occupied attack boards can only move forward or to the side.
<p>The diagram to the right should help to better understand the meaning
of "adjacent pin". A 'black' attack board located at Queen's Level 6
(QL6) has three adjacent pins: QL5 and QL4 can be reached with a move
forward, King's Level 6 (KL6) can be reached with a move to the
side.<br />
A 'white' attack board located at QL3 has five adjacent pins: QL5, QL4
and QL2 in front, KL3 beside and QL1 inverted (i.e. backward).</p></td>

Article 4: The act of moving the pieces

4.1 Players should feel free to use more than one hand when executing
moves (such as when moving attack boards) due to the special nature of
the 3D-Chess-Set.

4.2 Provided that he first expresses his intention (e.g. by saying
"j'adoube"), the player having the move may adjust one or more pieces on
their squares.

the first piece touched that can be moved or captured, or<br />
(b) one piece of each colour, he must capture the opponent's piece with
his piece or, if this is illegal, move or capture the first piece
touched which can be moved or captured. If it is unclear the player's
own piece shall be considered to have been touched before his
opponent's.</td>

castle on that side if it is legal.<br />
(b) If a player deliberately touches a rook and then his king he is not
allowed to castle on that side on that move and the situation shall be
governed by Article 4.3.<br />
(c) If a player, intending to castle touches the king or king and a rook
at the same time, but castling on that side is illegal, the player must
choose either to castle on the other side, provided that castling on
that side is legal, or to move his king. If the king has no legal move,
the player is free to make any legal move.</td>

4.5 If none of the pieces touched can be moved or captured, the player
may make any legal move.

4.6 If the opponent violates Article 4.3 or 4.4 the player cannot claim
this after he himself deliberately touches a piece.

4.7 When, as a legal move or part of a legal move, a piece has been
released on a square, it cannot then be moved to another square. The
move is considered to be made when all the relevant requirements of
Article 3 have been fulfilled.

5.2 The game is drawn when the player to move has no legal move and his
king is not in check. The game is said to end in 'stalemate'. This
immediately ends the game.

5.3 The game is drawn upon agreement between the two players during the
game. This immediately ends the game. (See Article 9.1)

5.4 The game may be drawn if the identical position is about to appear
or has appeared on the chessboard three times. (See Article 9.2)

5.5 The game may be drawn if the last 50 consecutive moves have been
made by each player without the movement of any pawn and without the
capture of any piece. (See Article 9.3)

TOURNAMENT RULES

Article 6: The chess clock

6.1 'Chess clock' means a clock with two time displays, connected to
each other in such a way that only one of them can run at one time.
'Clock' in the Laws of Chess means one of the two time displays. 'Flag
fall' means the expiry of the allotted time for a player.

6.2 When using a chess clock, each player must make a certain number or
all moves in an allotted period of time; or may be allocated an
additional amount of time after each move. All this must be specified in
advance. The time saved by a player during one period is added to his
time available for the next period, except in the 'time delay' mode. In
the time delay mode both players receive an allotted 'main thinking
time'. They also receive a 'fixed extra time' for every move. The count
down of the main time only commences after the fixed time has expired.
Provided the player stops his clock before the expiry of the fixed time,
the main thinking time does not change, irrespective of the proportion
of the fixed time used.

6.3 Each time display has a 'flag'. Immediately after a flag falls, the
requirements of Article 8.1 must be checked.

6.4 The arbiter decides where the chess clock is placed.

6.5 At the time determined for the start of the game the clock of the
player who has the white pieces is started.

6.6 The player shall lose the game if he arrives at the chessboard more
than one hour after the scheduled start of the session (unless the rules
of the competition specify or the arbiter decides otherwise).

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td data-valign="TOP">6.7</td>
<td>(a) During the game each player, having made his move on the
chessboard, shall stop his own clock and start his opponent's clock. A
player must always be allowed to stop his clock. His move is not
considered to have been completed until he has done so, unless the made
move ends the game. (See Articles 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3)<br />
The time between making the move on the chessboard and stopping his own
clock and starting his opponent's clock is regarded as part of the time
allotted to the player.<br />
(b) A player must stop his clock with the same hand as that with which
he made his move. It is forbidden to keep the finger on the button or to
'hover' over it.<br />
(c) The players must handle the chess clock properly. It is forbidden to
punch it forcibly, to pick it up or to knock it over. Improper clock
handling shall be penalised in accordance with Article 13.4.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

6.8 A flag is considered to have fallen when the arbiter observes the
fact or when a valid claim to that effect has been made by either
player.

6.9 Except where Articles 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 apply, if a player does not
complete the prescribed number of moves in the allotted time, the game
is lost by the player. However, the game is drawn, if the position is
such that the opponent cannot checkmate the player's king by any
possible series of legal moves, even with the most unskilled
counterplay.

6.10 Every indication given by the clocks is considered to be conclusive
in the absence of any evident defect. A chess clock with an evident
defect shall be replaced. The arbiter shall use his best judgement when
determining the times to be shown on the replacement chess clock.

6.11 If both flags have fallen and it is impossible to establish which
flag fell first, the game shall continue.

(b) A player may stop the clocks in order to seek the arbiter's
assistance.<br />
(c) The arbiter shall decide when the game is to be restarted.<br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

6.13 If an irregularity occurs and/or the pieces have to be restored to
a previous position, the arbiter shall use his best judgement to
determine the times to be shown on the clocks.

6.14 Screens, monitors, or demonstration boards showing the current
position on the chessboard, the moves and the number of moves made, and
clocks which also show the number of moves, are allowed in the playing
hall. However, the player may not make a claim based on anything shown
in this manner.

 

Article 7: Illegal positions

7.1 If during a game it is found that the initial position of the pieces
was incorrect, the game shall be cancelled and a new game played.

7.2 If a game has begun with colours reversed then it shall continue,
unless the arbiter rules otherwise.

7.3 If a player displaces one or more pieces, he shall re-establish the
correct position on his own time. If necessary the opponent has the
right to restart the player's clock without making a move in order to
make sure the player re-establishes the correct position on his own
time.

7.4 If during a game it is found that an illegal move has been made, or
that pieces have been displaced from their squares, the position before
the irregularity shall be re-instated. If the position immediately
before the irregularity cannot be identified the game shall continue
from the last identifiable position prior to the irregularity. The
clocks shall be adjusted according to Article 6.13 and, in the case of
an illegal move, Article 4.3 applies to the move replacing the illegal
move. The game shall then continue.

 

Article 8: The recording of the moves

8.1 In the course of play each player is required to record his own
moves and those of his opponent, move after move, as clearly and legibly
as possible, in the algebraic notation (Appendix E), on the scoresheet
prescribed for the competition.

A player may reply to his opponent's move before recording it, if he so
wishes. He must record his previous move before making another. The
offer of a draw must be recorded on the scoresheet by both
players.(Appendix E.12) If a player due to physical or religious
reasons, is unable to keep score, an amount of time, decided by the
arbiter, shall be deducted from his allotted time at the beginning of
the game.

8.2 The scoresheet shall be visible to the arbiter at all times.

8.3 The scoresheets are the property of the organisers of the event.

8.4 If a player has less than five minutes left on his clock and does
not have additional time of 30 seconds or more added with each move,
then he is not obliged to meet the requirements of Article 8.1.
Immediately after one flag has fallen the player must update his
scoresheet completely.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />

</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td data-valign="TOP">8.5</td>
<td>(a) If neither player is required to keep score under Article 8.4,
the arbiter or an assistant should try to be present and keep score. In
this case, immediately after one flag has fallen, the arbiter shall stop
the clocks. Then both players shall update their scoresheets, using the
arbiter's or the opponent's scoresheet.<br />
(b) If only one player is not required to keep score under Article 8.4,
he must update his scoresheet completely as soon as a flag has fallen.
Provided it is the player's move, he may use his opponent's scoresheet.
The player is not permitted to move until after he has completed his own
scoresheet and returned his opponent's.<br />
(c) If no complete scoresheet is available, the players must reconstruct
the game on a second chessboard under the control of the arbiter or an
assistant, who shall first record the actual game position before
reconstruction takes place.<br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

8.6 If the scoresheets cannot be brought up to date showing that a
player has overstepped the allotted time, the next move made shall be
considered as the first of the following time period, unless there is
evidence that more moves have been made.

 

Article 9: The drawn game

9.1 A player can propose a draw after making a move on the chessboard.
He must do so before stopping his own clock and starting his opponent's
clock. An offer at any other time during play is still valid, but
Article 12.5 must be considered. No conditions can be attached to the
offer. In both cases the offer cannot be withdrawn and remains valid
until the opponent accepts it, rejects it orally, rejects it by making a
move, or the game is concluded in some other way.

The offer of a draw shall be noted by each player on his scoresheet with
the symbol (=).

9.2 The game is drawn, upon a correct claim by the player having the
move, when the same position, for at least the third time (not
necessarily by repetition of moves)

\(a\) is about to appear, if he first writes his move on his scoresheet
and declares to the arbiter his intention to make this move, or  
(b) has just appeared.

Positions as in (a) and (b) are considered the same, if the same player
has the move, pieces of the same kind and colour occupy the same
squares, and the possible moves of all the pieces of both players are
the same. Positions are not the same if a pawn could have been captured
en passant or if the right to castle immediately or in the future has
been changed.

9.3 The game is drawn, upon a correct claim by the player having the
move, if

\(a\) he writes on his scoresheet, and declares to the arbiter his
intention to make a move which shall result in the last 50 moves having
been made by each player without the movement of any pawn and without
the capture of any piece, or  
(b) the last 50 consecutive moves have been made by each player without
the movement of any pawn and without the capture of any piece.

9.4 If the player makes a move without having claimed the draw he loses
the right to claim, as in Article 9.2 or 9.3, on that move .

9.5 If a player claims a draw as in Article 9.2 or 9.3 he shall
immediately stop both clocks. He is not allowed to withdraw his claim.

\(a\) If the claim is found to be correct the game is immediately
drawn.  
(b) If the claim is found to be incorrect, the arbiter shall deduct half
of the claimant's remaining time up to a maximum of three minutes and
add three minutes to the opponent's remaining time. Then the game shall
continue and the intended move must be made.

9.6 The game is drawn when a position is reached from which a checkmate
cannot occur by any possible series of legal moves, even with the most
unskilled play. This immediately ends the game.

 

Article 10: Quickplay Finish

10.1 A 'quickplay finish' is the last phase of a game, when all the
remaining moves must be made in a limited time.

10.2 If the player has less than two minutes left on his clock, he may
claim a draw before his flag falls. He shall stop the clocks and summon
the arbiter.

\(a\) If the arbiter is satisfied the opponent is making no effort to
win the game by normal means, or that it is not possible to win by
normal means, then he shall declare the game drawn. Otherwise he shall
postpone his decision.  
(b) If the arbiter postpones his decision, the opponent may be awarded
two extra minutes thinking time and the game shall continue in the
presence of the arbiter.  
(c) Having postponed his decision, the arbiter may subsequently declare
the game drawn, even after a flag has fallen.

10.3 Illegal moves do not necessarily lose. After the action taken under
Article 7.4, for a first illegal move by a player the arbiter shall give
two minutes extra time to his opponent; for a second illegal move by the
same player the arbiter shall give another two minutes extra time to his
opponent; for a third illegal move by the same player, the arbiter shall
declare the game lost by the player who played incorrectly.

10.4 If both flags have fallen and it is impossible to establish which
flag fell first the game is drawn.

<td>(a) If a game is not finished at the end of the time prescribed for
play, the arbiter shall require the player having the move to 'seal'
that move. The player must write his move in unambiguous notation on his
scoresheet, put his scoresheet and that of his opponent in an envelope,
seal the envelope and only then stop his clock without starting the
opponent's clock. Until he has stopped the clocks, the player retains
the right to change his sealed move. If, after being told by the arbiter
to seal his move, the player makes a move on the chessboard, he must
write that same move on his scoresheet as his sealed move.<br />
(b) A player having the move, who adjourns the game before the end of
the playing session, shall be considered to have sealed at the nominal
time for the end of the session.</td>

the offer is valid until the opponent has accepted it or rejected it as
in Article 9.1.

A5. Before the game is to be resumed, the position immediately before
the sealed move shall be set up on the chessboard, and the times used by
each player when the game was adjourned shall be indicated on the
clocks.

A6. If prior to the resumption the game is agreed drawn, or if one of
the players notifies the arbiter that he resigns, the game is concluded.

A12. If, upon resumption of the game, either player points out before
making his first move, that the time used has been incorrectly indicated
on either clock, the error must be corrected. If the error is not then
established the game continues without correction unless the arbiter
feels that the consequences will be too severe.

A13. The duration of each resumption session shall be controlled by the
arbiter's time piece. The starting time and finishing time shall be
announced in advance.

 

B. Rapidplay

B1. A 'rapidplay game' is one where all the moves must be made in a
fixed time between 15 to 60 minutes.

B2. Play shall be governed by the Laws of Chess, except where they are
overridden by the following Laws.

B3. Players do not need to record the moves.

B4. Once each player has made three moves, no claim can be made
regarding incorrect piece placement, orientation of the chessboard or
clock setting.

B5. The arbiter shall make a ruling according to Articles 4 and 10, only
if requested to do so by one or both players.

B6. The flag is considered to have fallen when a valid claim to that
effect has been made by a player. The arbiter shall refrain from
signalling a flag fall.

B7. To claim a win on time, the claimant must stop both clocks and
notify the arbiter. For the claim to be successful, the claimant's flag
must remain up and his opponent's flag down after the clocks have been
stopped.

B8. If both flags have fallen, the game is drawn.

 

C. Blitz

C1. A 'blitz game' is one where all the moves must be made in a fixed
time less than 15 minutes.

C2. Play shall be governed by the Rapidplay Laws as in Appendix B except
where they are overridden by the following Laws.

C3. An illegal move is completed once the opponent's clock has been
started. The opponent is then entitled to claim a win before making his
own move. Once the opponent has made his own move, an illegal move
cannot be corrected.

C4. In order to win, a player must have 'mating potential'. This is
defined as adequate forces eventually to produce a position legally,
possibly by 'helpmate', where an opponent having the move cannot avoid
being checkmated in one move. Thus two knights and a king against a lone
king is insufficient, but a rook and king against a knight and king is
sufficient.

C5. Article 10.2 does not apply.

 

D. Quickplay finishes where no arbiter is present in the venue.

D1. Where games are played as in Article 10, a player may claim a draw
when he has less than two minutes left on his clock and before his flag
falls. This concludes the game. He may claim on the basis

\(a\) that his opponent cannot win by normal means, or  
(b) that his opponent has been making no effort to win by normal means.

In (a) the player must write down the final position and his opponent
verify it.  
In (b) the player must write down the final position and submit an
up-to-date scoresheet which must be completed before play has ceased.
The opponent shall verify both the scoresheet and the final position.

The claim shall be referred to an arbiter whose decision shall be final.

 

E. Algebraic notation

Hereby the use of the Algebraic chess notation is recommended for
tournaments and for chess literature and periodicals. Scoresheets using
a notation system other than algebraic may not be used as evidence in
cases where normally the scoresheet of a player is used for that
purpose. An arbiter who observes that a player is using a notation
system other than the algebraic should inform the player in question of
this requirement.

**Description of the Algebraic System**

E1. The files (from left to right for White and from right to left for
Black) are indicated by the small letters, z, a, b, c, d and e,
respectively.

E2. The ten ranks (from front to back for White and from back to front
for Black) are numbered 0,1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, respectively.
Consequently, in the initial position the white pieces and pawns are
placed on ranks 0, 1 and 2; the black pieces and pawns on ranks 7, 8 and
9.

E3. The levels are indicated by capital letters: B = 'Black's' Board, N
= 'Neutral' Board, W = 'White's' Board.

The position of an attack board is indicated by capital letters and a
number:

(from left to right for White and from right to left for Black) QL =
Queen's Level and KL = King's Level, and

(from front to back for White and from back to front for Black) 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6 (See diagrams, Articles 2 and 3)

E4. As a consequence of the previous rules, each of the squares is
invariably indicated by a unique combination of a letter, a number and a
level declaration.

E5. Each piece is indicated by the first letter, a capital letter, of
its name. Example: K = king, Q = queen, R = rook,

B = bishop, N = knight. (In the case of the knight, for the sake of
convenience, N is used.)

E6. For the letter of the name of a piece (or attack board position) ,
each player is free to use the first letter of the name which is
commonly used in his country. Examples: F = fou (French for bishop), L =
loper (Dutch for bishop). In printed periodicals, the use of figurines
for the pieces is recommended.

E7. Pawns are not indicated by their first letter, but are recognized by
the absence of such a letter. Examples: d6B, c4N, a4W.

E8. Attack boards are recognized by the absence of the file and rank
declaration. Examples: QL1, QL5, KL3.

E9. Each move of a piece (or of an attack board) is indicated by (a) the
first letter of the name of the piece in question and (b) the square of
arrival. There is no hyphen between (a) and (b). Examples: Bd5N, Nc6B,
Rd0KL1. In the case of pawns, only the square of arrival is indicated.
Examples: d6B, c4N, a4W. In the case of attack boards, only the pin of
arrival is indicated. Examples: QL1, QL5, KL3.

E10. When a piece makes a capture, an x is inserted between  

\(a\) the first letter of the name of the piece in question and  
(b) the square of arrival.  
Examples: Bxd5N, Nxc6B, Rxd0KL1.

When a pawn makes a capture, not only the square of arrival but also the
file (and the level) of departure must be indicated, followed by an x.
Examples: aWxb4W, cBxb6N, dWxe5KL5. In the case of an "en passant"
capture, the square of arrival is given as the square on which the
capturing pawn finally rests and "e.p." is appended to the notation.

E11. If two identical pieces can move to the same square, the piece that
is moved is indicated as follows:

\(1\) If both pieces are on the same rank, but different files: by  
(a) the first letter of the name of the piece,  
(b) the file of the square of departure, and  
(c) the square of arrival.

\(2\) If both pieces are on the same file, but different ranks: by  
(a) the first letter of the name of the piece,  
(b) the rank of the square of departure, and  
(c) the square of arrival.

\(3\) If the pieces are on different ranks and files, method (1) is
preferred.  

\(4\) If the pieces are on same ranks and files, but different levels:
by  
(a) the first letter of the name of the piece,  
(b) the level of the square of departure, and  
(c) the square of arrival.

In the case of capture, an x must be inserted between (b) and (c).

Examples:

\(1\) There are two knights, on the squares b3W and d3W, and one of them
moves to the square c5N: either Nbc5N or Ndc5N, as the case may be.  
(2) There are two knights, on the squares b3W and b7B, and one of them
moves to the square c5N: either N3c5N or N7c5N, as the case may be.  
(3) There are two knights, on the squares b3W and a4N, and one of them
moves to the square c5N: either Nbc5N or Nac5N, as the case may be.  
(4) There are two knights, on the squares b3W and b3N, and one of them
moves to the square c5N: either NWc5N or NNc5N, as the case may be.

If a capture takes place on the square c5N, the previous examples are
changed by the insertion of an x:

\(1\) either Nbxc5N or Ndxc5N,  
(2) either N3xc5N or N7xc5N,  
(3) either Nbxc5N or Naxc5N,  
(4) either NWxc5N or NNxc5N, as the case may be.

E12. If two pawns (on different files) can capture the same piece or
pawn of the opponent, the pawn that is moved is indicated by

\(a\) the letter of the file of departure,  
(b) an x,  
(c) the square of arrival.

Example: If there are white pawns on squares a3W and c3W and a black
pawn or piece on the square b4N, the notation for White's move is either
axb4N or cxb4N, as the case may be.

If two pawns are on same ranks and files, but different levels, the pawn
that is moved is indicated by

\(a\) the letter of the file of departure,  
(b) the level of the square of departure,  
(c) the square of arrival.

In the case of capture, an x must be inserted between (b) and (c).

Example: If there are white pawns on squares a3W and a3N, the notation
for White's move is either aWa4N or aNa4N, as the case may be.  
If a black pawn or piece is captured on the square b4N, the notation for
White's move is either aWxb4N or aNxb4N, as the case may be.

E13. If two attack boards can move to the same pin, the attack board
that is moved is indicated by

\(a\) the level of departure,  
(b) a hyphen, and  
(c) the level of arrival.

Example: If there are attack boards (each occupied with only one white
pawn) on KL1 and QL3, and one of them moves to KL3, the notation for
White's move is either KL1-KL3 or QL3-KL3, as the case may be.

E14. In the case of the promotion of a pawn, the actual pawn move is
indicated, followed immediately by the first letter of the new piece.
Examples: d8BQ, e9KL6N, b1WB, d0KL1R.

E15. The offer of a draw shall be marked as (=).

*Essential Abbreviations:*  
0-0 : castling with rook e0KL1 or rook e9KL6 (kingside castling)  
0-0-0 : castling with rook z0QL1 or rook z9QL6 (queenside castling)  
x : captures  
+: check  
++ or \# : checkmate  
e.p. : captures "en passant"
