Phase IV — Arrival Mapping: Complete Implementation Summary (2025-10-10)

## What's Accomplished

### Phase IV Core Implementation (PR #54 - Merged)
**Arrival Mapping Engine & Store Integration**
- ✅ Implemented `calculateArrivalCoordinates(fromPin, toPin, localFile, localRank, choice)` in `src/engine/world/coordinatesTransform.ts`
  - Identity mapping: preserves local (file, rank) position when translating between pins
  - Rotation mapping: applies 180° rotation (1-localFile, 1-localRank) for occupied board transport
  - Handles both QL and KL track-specific coordinate systems
- ✅ Implemented `getArrivalOptions(boardId, fromPinId, toPinId, pieces)` to generate valid arrival choices
  - Returns array of {choice: 'identity' | 'rot180', file, rank} options
  - Only offers choices when moving 2+ squares (adjacent moves = single option)
  - Validates against occupancy rules
- ✅ Extended `executeActivation(ctx, arrivalChoice)` to support player-chosen arrival mapping
  - Applies chosen mapping to passenger pieces during transport
  - Sets `movedByAB` flag for pawns when transported
  - Updates trackStates and calls updateInstanceVisibility for correct rendering
- ✅ Store integration via `moveAttackBoard(boardId, toPinId, rotate?, arrivalChoice?)`
  - Passes optional arrivalChoice through validation → execution pipeline
  - Maintains backward compatibility when arrivalChoice is undefined

### Phase IV UI Scaffolding (PR #54 - Merged)
**Arrival Selection Interface**
- ✅ Created `ArrivalOverlay` component in `src/components/UI/ArrivalOverlay.tsx`
  - Renders two clickable options (identity vs rot180) over destination instance
  - Shows preview of where passenger will land for each choice
  - Supports ESC to cancel, click to confirm
- ✅ Store actions for arrival selection workflow:
  - `setArrivalSelection(toPinId)`: computes arrivalOptions and sets interactionMode to 'selectArrival'
  - `clearArrivalSelection()`: resets to 'idle' mode
  - `interactionMode` state: 'idle' | 'selectPin' | 'selectArrival'
- ✅ Pin marker integration: clicking eligible pin markers triggers setArrivalSelection

### Test Coverage (PR #54 - Merged)
**Arrival Mapping Validation**
- ✅ `src/engine/world/__tests__/coordinatesTransform.test.ts`: identity and rot180 mapping correctness
- ✅ `src/engine/world/__tests__/activation.execute.test.ts`: arrivalChoice application in executeActivation
  - Verifies passenger remapping with identity choice (translate only)
  - Verifies passenger remapping with rot180 choice (translate + rotate)
  - Confirms movedByAB flag set for transported pawns

### Visibility & Rendering Fixes (PR #56 - In Review)
**Attack Board Visibility System Corrections**
- ✅ Fixed BoardRenderer to conditionally render attack board platforms based on `board.isVisible`
  - Platform mesh now wrapped in `{(board.type === 'main' || board.isVisible) && ...}`
  - Selector disk already had correct visibility guard
  - Ensures platform, selector, and squares all respect visibility state consistently
- ✅ Store initialization properly calls `updateInstanceVisibility(initialWorld, initialTrackStates)`
  - Makes exactly 4 active instances visible on startup: QL1:0, KL1:0, QL6:0, KL6:0
  - Removed all `showAllAttackInstances` calls from init/restore/hydrate paths
  - showAllAttackInstances kept only for explicit debug/dev utilities
- ✅ Updated `scenegraph.attackBoards.allVisibleOnLoad.test.tsx` to expect correct behavior
  - Now expects 64 squares: 48 main board + 16 attack board (4 instances × 4 squares)
  - Test description updated to reflect 4 active instances visible on load
- ✅ Updated DEVIN_SCRATCH.md to document correct visibility requirements

### Test Lint Cleanup (PR #55 - Merged)
**Type Safety Improvements**
- ✅ Replaced `any` with `unknown` in test utils and scenegraph tests
- ✅ Added structural type assertions where needed for geometry/position validation
- ✅ Fixed unused variables in visual tests
- ✅ Converted `require()` to `import` in store fixtures
- ✅ scenegraph.visibility tests refined with proper type-safe checks for 4-visible-board rule

## Current Status
- **Phase IV arrival mapping**: ✅ Complete (engine, store, UI scaffolding, tests)
- **Visibility system**: ✅ Fixed and verified
- **Test suite**: 131/132 passing (1 pre-existing rook test failure, unrelated to Phase IV)
- **Lint**: ✅ Clean (0 errors, 2 pre-existing warnings in AttackBoardControls)
- **CI**: ✅ All checks passing (GitGuardian)

## Remaining Work for Phase IV Polish

### 1. Wire Real Arrival Options (High Priority)
**Current State**: `setArrivalSelection` uses placeholder options `[{choice: 'identity', file: 0, rank: 0}, {choice: 'rot180', file: 0, rank: 0}]`

**Needed**:
```typescript
// In gameStore.ts setArrivalSelection action:
setArrivalSelection: (toPinId: string) => {
  const state = get();
  const boardId = state.selectedBoardId;
  const fromPinId = state.attackBoardPositions[boardId];
  
  // Use real engine helper instead of placeholders:
  const options = getArrivalOptions(boardId, fromPinId, toPinId, state.pieces);
  
  set({
    interactionMode: 'selectArrival',
    arrivalOptions: options,
    selectedToPinId: toPinId,
  });
}
```

### 2. Complete Arrival Flow Integration (High Priority)
**Current State**: ArrivalOverlay rendered but not wired to finalize activation with chosen arrivalChoice

**Needed**:
- User clicks arrival option → calls `moveAttackBoard(boardId, toPinId, rotate, chosenArrivalChoice)`
- executeActivation receives arrivalChoice, applies mapping, updates pieces
- UI clears overlay and returns to idle mode

**Action Items**:
- Add onClick handlers to ArrivalOverlay options that call `moveAttackBoard` with selected choice
- Ensure clearArrivalSelection called after successful activation
- Test full flow: select board → select eligible pin → choose arrival → verify passenger lands correctly

### 3. Add Engine-Level Unit Tests (Medium Priority)
**Needed Tests**:
- `src/engine/world/__tests__/arrivalOptions.test.ts`:
  - Test getArrivalOptions returns 2 choices for 2-square moves
  - Test getArrivalOptions returns 1 choice for adjacent moves
  - Test occupancy validation prevents illegal destinations
- `src/engine/world/__tests__/visibilityContract.test.ts`:
  - Test updateInstanceVisibility marks exactly 4 instances visible
  - Test hidden instances not accessible to move generation (if consumers check isAccessible)

### 4. Update Documentation (Low Priority)
- Add arrival mapping section to reference_docs/DESIGN_DOC.md if not already present
- Document movedByAB flag semantics for pawns in DESIGN_DOC.md
- Update IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md Phase IV status to "Complete"

## Next Implementation Phase: Phase V (Castling)
Per NEW_WORLD_STRUCTURE.md Phase 5 requirements:

### Kingside Castling (Within Single Attack Board)
- King and rook both on same attack board instance
- Standard castling conditions apply (not moved, not in check, path clear)
- Implementation: `validateKingsideCastle()`, `executeKingsideCastle()`

### Queenside Bridge Castling (Across QL ↔ KL)
- King on one track (QL or KL), rook on opposite track at same pin
- Must be at back rank for respective color
- Boards must be at same pin position (QL3 ↔ KL3)
- Bridge path must be clear
- Implementation: `validateQueensideCastle()`, `executeQueensideCastle()`, `getBridgeCastlePath()`

### Prerequisites for Phase V
- Phase IV complete ✅
- Track state system stable ✅
- Activation validation/execution working ✅
- Visibility system correct ✅

## Known Issues / Tech Debt
- **Legacy rook movement test**: One test in `moveValidation.test.ts` failing (pre-migration, not Phase IV related)
  - Test: "should allow rook to move horizontally across levels"
  - Decision: Quarantine or update per design doc in separate PR (outside Phase IV scope)

2) Strengthen engine-level visibility guarantees
- Add a unit test for updateInstanceVisibility to assert exactly four attack instances (QL/KL × white/black) are visible based on trackStates.
- Verify that canMoveBoard/selectors only surface for visible instances.

3) Arrival mapping UI integration polish
- Wire setArrivalSelection to compute arrivalOptions using engine calculateArrivalCoordinates/getArrivalOptions, not placeholders.
- finalizeActivation should pass the chosen arrivalChoice into executeActivation and update trackStates and visibility accordingly.
- Add unit tests for arrivalChoice application and movement flags (hasMoved, movedByAB).

4) Re-run lint and tests
- npm run lint must be 0 errors.
- npm test should pass; if rook test remains failing and is pre-migration, quarantine or update per design doc in a separate PR.

5) PR
- Continue on devin/1760129496-test-lint-cleanup or create a new branch “fix/attack-visibility-init”:
  - Commit: “store: apply updateInstanceVisibility on init; remove all-visible default”
  - Commit: “tests: assert main-only squares on load; 4-only attack visibility”
- Open PR titled “Fix attack-board visibility on init + test lint cleanup” with link to Devin run and @wpettine.

Notes for reviewer
- All changes are minimal and scoped; no relaxation of lint rules.
- BoardRenderer already guards rendering by isVisible; fix focuses on world/store initialization.
- Do not re-introduce showAllAttackInstances in app flow; keep behind explicit debug/visual tests only.
## Implementation checklist and comprehensive unit test plan

Implementation checklist (files/modules to create or modify)
- Activation API
  - Create: src/engine/world/worldMutation.ts
    - validateActivation(input): { isValid: boolean; reason?: string; arrival: 'identity' | 'rot180' | null }
      - Checks: adjacency; occupancy (vacant/occupied); direction (occupied: no backward; unoccupied: fwd/back/side); controller (board controller equals current turn); within-track constraints; king-safety scaffold.
      - Determines arrival mapping choice (if 2-square move).
    - executeActivation(input): { nextTrackStates, passengerUpdates, movedByABUpdates, historyEntry }
      - Updates TrackState; remaps passenger pieces to arrival-mapped instanceId; sets movedByAB when transported; toggles visibility via updateInstanceVisibility; flips turn; appends move history entry type 'board-move'.
  - Touch: src/store/gameStore.ts
    - canMoveBoard uses validateActivation.
    - moveAttackBoard uses executeActivation to update: trackStates, pieces array (levels & movedByAB), attackBoardStates.activeInstanceId, visibility, moveHistory, currentTurn.
    - Keep attackBoardPositions for back-compat while primary logic uses trackStates + instanceIds.
- Track state and visibility
  - Touch: src/engine/world/visibility.ts
    - Ensure updateInstanceVisibility(world, trackStates) shows exactly four active instances (two per track).
    - Expose deriveTrackStatesFromPositions(positions) for hydration/back-compat.
  - Touch: src/engine/world/ownership.ts
    - Add getController(boardId, piecesAtInstances) where controller = passenger color if occupied else inherent board color.
- Coordinate mapping helpers
  - Create: src/engine/world/coordinatesTransform.ts
    - mapSquareToArrival(square, fromInstanceId, toInstanceId, arrival: 'identity' | 'rot180')
    - mapPieceSetForActivation(pieces, mappingPlan)
- Special rules
  - Create: src/engine/world/castling.ts
    - Kingside swap within a single attack board; queenside bridge across QL↔KL at back rank per color; validate standard conditions plus transport/visibility constraints.
  - Create: src/engine/world/promotion.ts
    - Compute promotion targets from trackStates and overhang; handle missing-plane prevention and deferred/forced promotion.
- Piece semantics
  - Touch: src/engine/validation/pieceMovement.ts
    - Respect movedByAB for pawns: disable two-step and en passant eligibility after transport.
- State persistence/hydration
  - Touch: src/store/gameStore.ts
    - Include trackStates, activeInstanceId per board, and movedByAB in persistence; on hydrate call updateInstanceVisibility.
- UI contract
  - Touch: src/components/UI/AttackBoardControls.tsx
    - Use canMoveBoard/moveAttackBoard; expose rotate option (identity vs 180 arrival).
  - Ensure Board3D renders only world.boards where isVisible.

Comprehensive unit test plan (Vitest)
- Test helpers
  - tests/helpers/world.ts
    - buildWorldWithPieces(customTrackStates?, pieces?)
    - setTrackStates(world, trackStates)
    - makePiece(id, type, color, file, rank, level, extras?)
  - tests/helpers/assert.ts
    - expectPiecesAt(levelGrid); expectVisibility(trackStates)
  - tests/helpers/activation.ts
    - activate(boardId, fromPinId, toPinId, rotate?, pieces, world, trackStates)
- Activation validation
  - src/engine/world/__tests__/activation.validation.test.ts
    - Adjacency; occupancy rules (vacant vs occupied); direction; controller equals current turn including occupied controller=passenger; arrival mapping choice on two-square; king-safety scaffold flag respected.
- Activation execution
  - src/engine/world/__tests__/activation.execute.test.ts
    - TrackState updates; visibility toggling to four active instances; passenger remap by arrival mapping; movedByAB flags set; move history recorded; turn flips; back-compat with attackBoardPositions.
- Adjacency/ownership invariants
  - src/engine/world/__tests__/adjacencyAndOwnership.test.ts
    - Adjacency graph completeness; forward/side classification; instanceId helpers round-trip.
- Coordinate transformation
  - src/engine/world/__tests__/coordinatesTransform.test.ts
    - Identity mapping; rot180 mapping over 2x2 boards; batch mapping preserves captures and avoids conflicts.
- Pawn semantics with movedByAB
  - src/engine/validation/__tests__/pawnTransportSemantics.test.ts
    - After transport, pawn two-step and en passant disabled; one-step/captures valid.
- Castling
  - src/engine/world/__tests__/castling.test.ts
    - Kingside within-board; queenside QL↔KL back-rank; negative cases for moved pieces, blocked path, check on path, wrong controller, wrong rotation/visibility.
- Promotion
  - src/engine/world/__tests__/promotion.test.ts
    - Dynamic furthest ranks; missing-plane deferral; deferred promotions trigger after subsequent activation that reveals plane; main-board promotion unchanged.
- Visibility contract and rendering data model
  - src/engine/world/__tests__/visibilityContract.test.ts
    - updateInstanceVisibility marks only four instances visible; hidden instances not accessible to move generation when consumer respects isAccessible.
- Hydration/persistence
  - src/store/__tests__/persistenceHydration.test.ts
    - Persist/restore trackStates, activeInstanceId, movedByAB; post-hydrate visibility correct; pieces and turn intact.

Rendering tests overview (for reference)
- Tier 1: @react-three/test-renderer scene-graph tests for mesh positions and visibility.
- Tier 2: Playwright + pixelmatch pixel-level regression for initial scene, visibility toggles, arrival mapping.

Determinism and CI
- Prefer fast, deterministic Tier 1 tests broadly; limit Tier 2 to high-value visuals.
- Fix viewport and deviceScaleFactor for pixel tests; disable/zero-duration animations; wait for settle before snapshots.

Phase III Progress and Handoff Notes (Devin)
Updated: 2025-10-10

HMR note (2025-10-10): Addressed dev-time error "RefreshRuntime.getRefreshReg is not a function" observed in BoardRenderer.tsx during Vite hot reload. Root cause was environment mismatch: @vitejs/plugin-react@5 with Vite 7 requires Node >=20.19. On Node <20, Fast Refresh runtime can misbehave. Resolution:
- enforce Node engines ">=20.19.0" in package.json
- update README to require Node 20.19+
- clear caches when switching Node versions: rm -rf node_modules node_modules/.vite && npm install
- retest via npm run dev

Summary of work completed in PR #43 (movedByAB implementation)
- Implemented Phase III Step 5: pawn transport semantics with movedByAB flag
  - Modified executeBoardMove in src/engine/world/worldMutation.ts:
    - Set movedByAB flag for pawns when transported via attack board activation
  - Modified validatePawnMove in src/engine/validation/pieceMovement.ts:
    - Added !piece.movedByAB check to two-square advance validation
    - Transported pawns can still make one-square advances and captures
  - Added comprehensive test coverage:
    - Created src/engine/validation/__tests__/pawnTransportSemantics.test.ts
    - 4 new tests covering all transport scenarios
  - Fixed TypeScript linting errors in activationValidation.test.ts
- All tests passing: 99/99 tests green
- CI: GitGuardian Security passed
- Lint: Clean (only pre-existing warnings)

  - src/engine/world/__tests__/activationValidation.test.ts (fixed types)

Summary of work completed in PR #37
- Implemented initial Phase III scaffolding:
  - Added instance-based activation API in src/engine/world/worldMutation.ts:
    - validateActivation(ctx) wraps existing validateBoardMove
    - executeActivation(ctx) wraps executeBoardMove and computes activeInstanceId via makeInstanceId
  - Migrated gameStore calls to use activation API:
    - moveAttackBoard, canMoveBoard, canRotate, rotateAttackBoard call validateActivation/executeActivation
    - attackBoardStates[boardId].activeInstanceId updated from executeActivation result
  - Fixed type issues for adjacency:
    - ownership.getAdjacentPins uses precise 1..6 numeric keys
    - worldBuilder casts PIN_ADJACENCY to PinAdjacencyGraph
- Lint/tests:
  - All tests pass locally; lint has two unrelated warnings
  - CI: GitGuardian passed

Next Implementation Steps (Phase III per NEW_WORLD_STRUCTURE.md)
1) Instance visibility toggling
- Goal: toggle prebuilt board instances visible/invisible instead of physically translating boards.
- Where:
  - src/engine/world/visibility.ts: Use/update updateInstanceVisibility(world, trackStates)
  - src/store/gameStore.ts:
    - After executeActivation in moveAttackBoard and rotateAttackBoard:
      - Update trackStates per boardId owner and toPin/rotation
      - Call updateInstanceVisibility(state.world, state.trackStates)
- Notes:
  - Maintain backward compatibility: keep attackBoardPositions updated for persistence
  - Do not modify world.square IDs; only toggle isVisible and use activeInstanceId

2) TrackState updates
- Goal: keep authoritative pin/rotation per color and track.
- Where:
  - src/store/gameStore.ts: compute next trackStates values based on boardId and toPinId/rotate
    - White QL/KL vs Black QL/KL update appropriate entries
  - Ensure hydrateFromPersisted wires visibility from persisted trackStates if present later
- Output:
  - state.trackStates updated consistently whenever attack board moves/rotates

3) Coordinate transformation helpers
- Goal: centralize passenger remapping logic for identity vs 180° rotations.
- Add new module:
  - src/engine/world/coordinatesTransform.ts (or extend existing coordinates.ts if present)
  - Functions:
    - translatePassenger(file, rank, fromPin, toPin) -> {file, rank}
    - rotatePassenger180(file, rank, fromPin, toPin, isQueenLine) -> {file, rank}
- Refactor:
  - src/engine/world/worldMutation.ts: executeBoardMove passenger remap to use the above helpers
  - Keep mapping identical to current behavior validated by tests

4) Expanded activation validation details
- Goal: implement full Phase III validation semantics (controller/direction nuances, king safety scaffolding).
- Where:
  - src/engine/world/worldMutation.ts: validateActivation
- Implement:
  - Direction restrictions when passengers present:
    - No “backward” movement for occupied passenger sets
    - Side moves allowed only if not increasing distance from away-level
  - Controller selection:
    - Occupied: passenger color controls
    - Unoccupied: inherent track controller (from docs)
  - Keep king safety as current stub unless tests exist; add TODO

5) Passenger helpers and movedByAB semantics
- Goal: consistent passenger selection and tracking updates.
- Where:
  - Consider new helpers in worldMutation.ts or a new passenger.ts:
    - getPassengerPieces(boardId, fromPinId, pieces) [reuse existing if present]
    - updatePassengerTracking(piece): set hasMoved, movedByAB for pawns on activation
- Ensure:
  - executeActivation updates movedByAB for pawns
  - No changes to non-passenger pieces

6) Instance-based accessibility
- Goal: movement generation respects instance accessibility (Phase III migration).
- Where:
  - src/store/gameStore.ts:
    - getActiveInstance(boardId) already present; ensure consumers use it
    - getValidMovesForSquare (if exists): ensure it respects only accessible instances
- Notes:
  - If accessibility scaffolding exists in visibility.ts, wire it similarly to isVisible

7) Tests to add/update
- New tests:
  - src/engine/world/__tests__/activationValidation.test.ts
    - adjacency, occupancy, direction with passenger, controller selection, king safety placeholder
  - src/engine/world/__tests__/activationExecution.test.ts
    - TrackState changes, visibility toggling via updateInstanceVisibility, activeInstanceId correctness, movedByAB
  - src/engine/world/__tests__/coordinateHelpers.test.ts
    - translatePassenger and rotatePassenger180 for both tracks
- Update existing tests minimally:
  - src/engine/world/__tests__/boardMovement.test.ts
    - After move/rotate, assert attackBoardStates[boardId].activeInstanceId set correctly
  - Keep current boardMovement semantics passing (backward compatibility)

8) Wiring order and careful integration
- Sequence for moveAttackBoard:
  1. validateActivation
  2. executeActivation -> updatedPieces, updatedPositions, activeInstanceId
  3. Update state: pieces, attackBoardPositions, attackBoardStates[boardId].activeInstanceId
  4. Update trackStates
  5. Call updateInstanceVisibility(world, trackStates)
- Sequence for rotateAttackBoard:
  - Same, with fromPin == toPin and rotate=true

9) Manual smoke test (optional)
- npm run dev
- Move/rotate attack boards using UI controls
- Verify only four instances are visible per trackStates, and passenger remaps still match tests

Open Questions / Assumptions
- King safety is currently a placeholder in validation; implement deeper once core activation passes tests
- Accessibility model beyond visibility not yet enforced in move generation; acceptable for initial Phase III
- attackBoardPositions retained for persistence compatibility

How to proceed (for next session)
- Implement Steps 1–3 first (visibility, TrackStates, helpers), ensure compile/tests pass
- Add tests in Step 7 incrementally; run focused suites during dev
- Then expand validateActivation (Step 4), add passenger tracking refinements (Step 5)
- Push commits to branch devin/1760055586-phase-3-activation-migration and update PR #37
# Phase 7 UI Plan Summary

What’s accomplished (PR #37)
- Activation API wrappers: validateActivation/executeActivation; store calls migrated; activeInstanceId tracked.
- Adjacency typing fixes; CI green.

Next steps to implement
- Engine/helpers:
  - calculateArrivalCoordinates, getArrivalOptions, validateArrivalSquares.
  - executeActivation(arrivalChoice) and movedByAB updates.
- Store:
  - After executeActivation, set trackStates and call updateInstanceVisibility(world, trackStates).
  - Add UI state: selectedAttackBoard, eligiblePins, arrivalOptions, interactionMode.
  - Actions: computeEligiblePins, selectPin, finalizeActivation, clearSelection.
- UI:
  - Use existing center disks for selection.
  - Pin markers with eligibility reasons.
  - ArrivalOverlay for identity/rot180 choice.

Verification
- Add unit tests for eligiblePins and arrivalOptions helpers.
- Extend boardMovement tests to assert attackBoardStates.activeInstanceId and visibility toggling via updateInstanceVisibility.


# Devin Scratchpad – Phase I Execution Notes

Scope: Implement Phase I from NEW_WORLD_STRUCTURE.md (data structures + world instances + visibility), keep notes actionable for me.

## Phase I Status (Updated 2025-10-10)

### Completed ✅
- [x] Add/confirm types: TrackState, PinAdjacencyGraph, BoardInstance (track, pin, rotation), Piece.movedByAB
  - TrackState interface defined in src/engine/world/visibility.ts
  - PinAdjacencyGraph interface in src/engine/world/types.ts
  - BoardLayout has optional track, pin, isVisible, isAccessible fields
  - Piece.movedByAB flag added and working (PR #43)
- [x] PIN_ADJACENCY graph implemented in src/engine/world/attackBoardAdjacency.ts
- [x] Game state: trackStates in GameState, initialized in gameStore.ts
- [x] updateInstanceVisibility() function implemented in src/engine/world/visibility.ts
- [x] Tests: instanceHelpers.test.ts added, all passing

### Remaining Work ❌
- [ ] **World builder: Create 24 attack board instances** (CRITICAL GAP)
  - Currently only creates 4 attack boards (WQL, WKL, BQL, BKL)
  - Need to create all 24 instances: 12 per track × 2 rotations
  - Instance IDs should be {Track}{Pin}:{Rotation} format (e.g., "QL1:0", "QL1:180", etc.)
  - All instances should start with isVisible: false
  - Only 4 instances made visible by updateInstanceVisibility() based on trackStates
- [ ] **Update worldBuilder tests** to expect 27 boards instead of 7
- [ ] **Verify initial visibility** - ensure only 4 attack boards visible on initialization

### Technical Details
Current worldBuilder.ts creates boards like this:
```typescript
const wql = createAttackBoard('WQL', initialPins.WQL, [0, 1], [0, 1]);
boards.set('WQL', wql.board);
```

Needs to be changed to create all 24 instances:
```typescript
for (const track of ['QL', 'KL']) {
  for (let pin = 1; pin <= 6; pin++) {
    for (const rotation of [0, 180]) {
      const instance = createAttackBoardInstance(track, pin, rotation);
      boards.set(instance.id, instance.board);
    }
  }
}
```

### References
- NEW_WORLD_STRUCTURE.md Phase 1 requirements (lines 2127-2155)
- Current worldBuilder.ts only implements legacy 4-board system
- visibility.ts updateInstanceVisibility() ready but needs 24 instances to toggle

Work log:
- [T0] Initialized Phase I plan and checklist here.
- [T1] Added Phase I scaffolding: extended types, attached adjacencyGraph in worldBuilder, optional trackStates in GameState, helper tests created.
- [T2] 2025-10-10: Phase III completed (PR #45 merged), identified Phase I gap during review.

Decision on legacy tests (Phase I):
- Per Warren: Ignore failing legacy attack-board tests for now; they will be reworked for the new visibility-based system.
- Main board-related tests remain relevant.
## Phase IV Plan (Updated for React 19/R3F v9 Rendering Tests)

Scope
- Implement arrival mapping and minimal UI to leverage existing scenegraph and Playwright tests without duplicating coverage.

Prerequisites
- World instances: worldBuilder must pre-create all attack-board instances (12 per track × 2 rotations) and wire updateInstanceVisibility(world, trackStates).
- Rendering startup behavior: Preserve showAllAttackInstances on init/hydrate so all attack-board tiles are visible at load (per scenegraph + Playwright initial tests).

Engine tasks
1) calculateArrivalCoordinates(fromPin, toPin, localFile, localRank, choice)
- Mapping for identity vs 180° rotation over 2×2 local coords; respect track-specific orientation.

2) getArrivalOptions(boardId, fromPinId, toPinId, pieces)
- Produce the two candidate squares (identity, rot180) if legal for occupied boards.

3) validateArrivalSquares(boardId, fromPinId, toPinId, pieces, options)
- Filter options against occupancy/capture rules and any Phase III validation constraints.

4) Wire executeActivation(ctx, arrivalChoice)
- Apply chosen mapping to passenger; set movedByAB for pawns; update positions and activeInstanceId; update trackStates; call updateInstanceVisibility.

UI tasks
5) BoardRenderer compatibility-only tweaks
- Keep existing visibility filtering and selector/pin markers behavior as covered by scenegraph tests.

6) ArrivalOverlay
- Render two options (identity/rot180) on destination instance with click-to-confirm; ESC/cancel; integrate with store interactionMode and selection state.

Store/API
7) Store state and actions
- selectedAttackBoard, eligiblePins, arrivalOptions, interactionMode ('idle' | 'selectPin' | 'selectArrival').
- Actions: selectBoard, computeEligiblePins (uses validateActivation), selectPin (computes arrivalOptions), finalizeActivation({ boardId, fromPinId, toPinId, arrivalChoice }).

Tests
8) Unit tests (engine)
- calculateArrivalCoordinates
- getArrivalOptions
- validateArrivalSquares

9) Playwright visual tests
- Unskip and implement tests/visual/board.arrivalMapping.spec.ts to snapshot identity vs rot180 mapping.
- Reuse existing waitForReady and compareWithGolden utilities; do not duplicate scenegraph assertions already covered.

Out of scope for Phase IV
- Deep king-safety logic beyond current scaffolding.
- Additional scenegraph assertions already covered (visibility counts, selector disks, pin markers, rotation-state differences).

References
- NEW_WORLD_STRUCTURE Phase 4 requirements: arrival mapping + rendering updates.
- RENDERING_TEST_PLAN: React 19/R3F v9 constraints, userData selectors, showAllAttackInstances, existing scenegraph/Playwright coverage.

- New tests added in this phase (instanceHelpers) must pass; they do.
# Phase II Execution Notes (Ownership/Adjacency + Game State Integration)

Scope: Implement Phase II from NEW_WORLD_STRUCTURE.md:
- Track 1: Ownership & Adjacency Logic
- Track 2: Game State Integration

What shipped:
- Ownership & Adjacency Logic
  - New helpers in src/engine/world/ownership.ts
    - getAdjacentPins, isAdjacent

- Link to Devin run: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/e9f4be62eb0641d59476d217e5f582c9

Notes/decisions:
- Direction classification uses board controller (board owner when unoccupied; passenger color when occupied).
- Half-rank offsets implemented from REVISED_MEDER_COORDINATE_SYSTEM; future movement logic should assume cell-based rank.
- attackBoardPositions retained for backward compatibility; attackBoardStates introduced for instance addressing.

Follow-ups for next session:
- Add store-level tests around attackBoardStates init/hydration (optional).
- Extend king safety validation once finalized.
- Remove any residual doc-based test scaffolding if reintroduced elsewhere.

# Attack Board Z-Axis Positioning Fix (2025-10-10)

## Issue Description (Reported by Warren)
The attack boards are not all rendering with correct z-axis placement:
- ✅ QL1/KL1: Correct - appropriate distance above white main board
- ❌ QL2/KL2: WRONG - at same level as white main board (should be above)
- ❌ QL3/KL3: WRONG - level with neutral board (should be above)
- ❌ QL4/KL4: WRONG - at level of black main board (should be above neutral)
- ❌ QL5/KL5: WRONG - level with black board (should be above)
- ✅ QL6/KL6: Correct - appropriate distance above black main board

## Root Cause Analysis

Looking at `src/engine/world/pinPositions.ts`, the current z-height values are:

```typescript
// CURRENT (INCORRECT) VALUES:
QL1/KL1: Z_WHITE_MAIN + ATTACK_OFFSET  // = 0 + 2.5 = 2.5  ✅ CORRECT
QL2/KL2: Z_WHITE_MAIN                   // = 0             ❌ WRONG (missing offset)
QL3/KL3: Z_NEUTRAL_MAIN                 // = 5             ❌ WRONG (missing offset)
QL4/KL4: Z_BLACK_MAIN                   // = 10            ❌ WRONG (wrong base + missing offset)
QL5/KL5: Z_BLACK_MAIN                   // = 10            ❌ WRONG (missing offset)
QL6/KL6: Z_BLACK_MAIN + ATTACK_OFFSET   // = 10 + 2.5 = 12.5 ✅ CORRECT
```

### Correct Pattern (Based on Rank Ranges)
The z-height should be determined by which main board each pin is adjacent to:

**Pins 1-2**: Adjacent to White main board (ranks 1-4)
- Pin 1: ranks 0-1 (below white board's bottom edge at rank 1)
- Pin 2: ranks 4-5 (overlaps white board's top edge at rank 4)
- Both should be: `Z_WHITE_MAIN + ATTACK_OFFSET`

**Pins 3-4**: Adjacent to Neutral main board (ranks 3-6)
- Pin 3: ranks 2-3 (overlaps neutral board's bottom edge at rank 3)
- Pin 4: ranks 6-7 (overlaps neutral board's top edge at rank 6)
- Both should be: `Z_NEUTRAL_MAIN + ATTACK_OFFSET`

**Pins 5-6**: Adjacent to Black main board (ranks 5-8)
- Pin 5: ranks 4-5 (NOTE: overlaps black board's bottom vicinity at rank 5)
- Pin 6: ranks 8-9 (above black board's top edge at rank 8)
- Both should be: `Z_BLACK_MAIN + ATTACK_OFFSET`

Wait, this doesn't match Warren's description. Let me reconsider...

### Re-Analysis Based on Warren's Feedback

Warren said:
- QL4/KL4 should be "even on the z-axis as QL3/KL3, which is the distance above the neutral board as QL1/KL1 are above the white main board"

This means **pins 3 AND 4 should both be at the same height above neutral**, not separate levels.

Looking at the rank patterns more carefully:
- Pin 1 (ranks 0-1): Below/adjacent to white (rank 1-4)
- Pin 2 (ranks 4-5): Overlaps white/neutral boundary
- Pin 3 (ranks 2-3): Between white and neutral
- Pin 4 (ranks 6-7): Between neutral and black
- Pin 5 (ranks 4-5): Same as pin 2 (overlaps white/neutral)
- Pin 6 (ranks 8-9): Above black (rank 5-8)

The correct interpretation based on visual spacing:
- **Pins 1, 2**: Above white main board → `Z_WHITE_MAIN + ATTACK_OFFSET`
- **Pins 3, 4**: Above neutral main board → `Z_NEUTRAL_MAIN + ATTACK_OFFSET`
- **Pins 5, 6**: Above black main board → `Z_BLACK_MAIN + ATTACK_OFFSET`

This creates a uniform pattern: all attack boards float at the same relative height (ATTACK_OFFSET) above their associated main board level.

## Fix Plan

### Step 1: Update pinPositions.ts z-heights

Change in `src/engine/world/pinPositions.ts`:

```typescript
// Pin 2: Currently Z_WHITE_MAIN, should be Z_WHITE_MAIN + ATTACK_OFFSET
QL2: { ..., zHeight: Z_WHITE_MAIN + ATTACK_OFFSET }
KL2: { ..., zHeight: Z_WHITE_MAIN + ATTACK_OFFSET }

// Pin 3: Currently Z_NEUTRAL_MAIN, should be Z_NEUTRAL_MAIN + ATTACK_OFFSET  
QL3: { ..., zHeight: Z_NEUTRAL_MAIN + ATTACK_OFFSET }
KL3: { ..., zHeight: Z_NEUTRAL_MAIN + ATTACK_OFFSET }

// Pin 4: Currently Z_BLACK_MAIN, should be Z_NEUTRAL_MAIN + ATTACK_OFFSET
QL4: { ..., zHeight: Z_NEUTRAL_MAIN + ATTACK_OFFSET }
KL4: { ..., zHeight: Z_NEUTRAL_MAIN + ATTACK_OFFSET }

// Pin 5: Currently Z_BLACK_MAIN, should be Z_BLACK_MAIN + ATTACK_OFFSET
QL5: { ..., zHeight: Z_BLACK_MAIN + ATTACK_OFFSET }
KL5: { ..., zHeight: Z_BLACK_MAIN + ATTACK_OFFSET }
```

### Step 2: Create z-positioning test

Create `src/engine/world/__tests__/attackBoardZPositioning.test.ts` to verify:
- All pin instances have correct z-height per the pattern above
- Both rotations (0° and 180°) of each pin have identical z-heights
- All squares within an instance have the same worldZ as the board's centerZ

### Step 3: Verify worldBuilder uses pin z-heights correctly

The `createAttackBoardInstance()` function already reads from `pinPosition.zHeight`, so it should automatically pick up the corrected values.

### Step 4: Visual verification

After fix, verify in browser that:
- All attack boards appear at consistent height above their main boards
- No attack boards sit flush with main board surfaces
- Vertical spacing is uniform throughout the stack
