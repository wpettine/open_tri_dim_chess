## Quick Context

This is a 3D Chess implementation following the Meder rules for Tri-Dimensional Chess. The project uses React + TypeScript + Three.js for 3D rendering.

### Phase 6: Move Validation System ‚úÖ
- Implemented legal move detection for all piece types (pawn, knight, bishop, rook, queen, king)
- Created path validation system with Vertical Shadow blocking
- Handled 3D movement rules across all 7 boards
- Comprehensive move validation for 3D chess environment

**Key Files Created:**
- `src/engine/validation/moveValidator.ts` - Main move validation orchestrator
- `src/engine/validation/pieceMovement.ts` - Piece-specific movement rules
- `src/engine/validation/pathValidation.ts` - Path clearing and blocking logic
- `src/engine/validation/types.ts` - Validation type definitions
- `src/engine/validation/__tests__/moveValidation.test.ts` - 18 comprehensive tests
- `src/engine/validation/__tests__/pathValidation.test.ts` - 9 path validation tests

**Key Implementation Details:**
- **Vertical Shadow Blocking**: When a piece moves through intermediate (file, rank) coordinates on ANY level, ALL other levels at those coordinates must be checked for blocking pieces (except knights)
- **3D Movement**: Pieces can move between boards via pins or diagonal/straight paths
- **Path Validation**: `isPathClear()` checks all intermediate squares including vertical shadows
- **Piece Rules**: All piece types follow official Raumschach rules from meder-rules.md

**Test Coverage:**
- 27 new tests (18 move validation + 9 path validation)
- Tests cover all piece types, 3D movement, vertical shadow blocking, edge cases

### Phase 7: Check & Checkmate Detection ‚úÖ
- Implemented check detection system (identifying when king is under attack)
- Created legal move filtering to prevent illegal moves that leave king in check
- Added checkmate and stalemate detection
- Integrated with game store for state tracking

**Key Files Created:**
- `src/engine/validation/checkDetection.ts` - Check/checkmate detection logic
- `src/engine/validation/__tests__/checkDetection.test.ts` - 15 comprehensive tests

**Key Files Modified:**
- `src/store/gameStore.ts` - Added check/checkmate state tracking and game state update logic

**Key Functions:**
- `isSquareAttacked(square, byColor, world, pieces)` - Detects if a square is under attack
- `isInCheck(color, world, pieces)` - Checks if a player's king is in check
- `getLegalMovesAvoidingCheck(piece, world, pieces)` - Filters moves to prevent self-check
- `isCheckmate(color, world, pieces)` - Detects checkmate (in check with no legal moves)
- `isStalemate(color, world, pieces)` - Detects stalemate (no legal moves, not in check)

**Implementation Details:**
- **Separation of Concerns**: `getLegalMoves()` returns all possible moves, `getLegalMovesAvoidingCheck()` filters for king safety
- **Move Simulation**: `simulateMove()` creates temporary board state to test if moves leave king in check
- **Pin Detection**: Automatically handled via filtering logic (no special pin detection needed)
- **3D Support**: Works correctly across all 7 boards by building on Phase 6's move validation

**Test Coverage:**
- 15 new tests covering attack detection, check detection, pinned pieces, checkmate, stalemate
- Fixed coordinate bugs: Ensured all test squares exist in world grid (proper rank ranges per board)

**Game Store Integration:**
- New state properties: `isCheck`, `isCheckmate`, `isStalemate`, `winner`
- New method: `updateGameState()` - Refreshes check/checkmate status after moves
- Enhanced: `getValidMovesForSquare()` - Now uses `getLegalMovesAvoidingCheck()` instead of `getLegalMoves()`

## Key Architecture Notes

### Attack Board Movement System

**Validation Flow:**
1. User selects attack board ‚Üí `selectedBoardId` set in gameStore
2. UI displays legal moves ‚Üí calls `getLegalBoardMoves()` (to be implemented)
3. User selects destination + rotation
4. System validates via `validateBoardMove()` in worldMutation.ts:
   - ‚úÖ Adjacency (with knight-aware multi-level support)
   - ‚úÖ Occupancy (destination not blocked by another board)
   - ‚úÖ Direction (forward/side/inverted rules)
   - ‚úÖ Vertical Shadow (pieces blocking path unless knight present)
   - üöß King Safety (currently stub, needs Phase 7 integration)
5. If valid, execute via `executeBoardMove()`:
   - Update attackBoardPositions
   - Move all passenger pieces
   - Apply rotation if specified (180¬∞ swaps quadrants)

**Knight Jump Special Rule:**
- Normally boards can move 0-2 levels on same line
- With knight passenger, can move 0-3 levels on same line
- Cross-line moves (QL‚ÜîKL) always allowed if adjacent
- Implementation: `hasKnight` check in adjacency validation

**Vertical Shadow:**
- Non-knight pieces on passenger squares block multi-level moves
- Knight passenger allows board to "jump over" blocking pieces
- Implementation: Check each intermediate level for obstructions

### Camera System Design

**World Dimensions:**
- X: 2.1 to 8.4 (Files 1-4)
- Y: 2.1 to 18.9 (Ranks 1-9)
- Z: 0 to 12 (Levels 0-6, doubled for spacing)
- **World Center:** [5, 10, 6]

**Camera Presets:**
All target world center [5, 10, 6] with specific tilts:
- Default: [15, 15, 20] - Isometric starting view
- Top: [5, 10, 25] - Overhead with 15¬∞ tilt for piece visibility
- Side: [25, 10, 6] - Profile with 10¬∞ tilt to see board levels
- Front: [5, -10, 10] - Traditional chess view with 20¬∞ tilt

**Animation:**
- Using gsap for smooth 0.8s transitions with 'power2.out' easing
- Animates both camera.position and controls.target simultaneously
- OrbitControls remain enabled for manual adjustment after preset

### UI Component Architecture

**Layout Strategy:**
```
Top-Left: CameraControls (z-index: 101)
Top-Right: MoveHistory (z-index: 99) OR BoardMovementPanel (z-index: 100)
```

**State Management:**
- Camera: Zustand store `useCameraStore` (separate from game state)
- Game: Existing `useGameStore` extended with board selection
- Move History: Direct access to gameStore.moveHistory
- No prop drilling - each component subscribes to relevant store slices

**Collision Handling:**
- When both MoveHistory and BoardMovementPanel visible, they overlap
- BoardMovementPanel has higher z-index (100 vs 99)
- Future: Consider vertical stacking or sliding panels

### Testing Status
```bash
npm test        # ‚úÖ 53/53 tests passing (5 test files)
npm run lint    # ‚úÖ No errors
npm run build   # ‚úÖ TypeScript compiles successfully
npm run dev     # ‚úÖ App runs at http://localhost:5173
```

**Test Breakdown:**
- `pathValidation.test.ts` - 9 tests (path clearing, vertical shadow blocking)
- `worldBuilder.test.ts` - 7 tests (world structure validation)
- `moveValidation.test.ts` - 18 tests (piece movement rules, 3D movement)
- `checkDetection.test.ts` - 15 tests (check, checkmate, stalemate detection)
- `coordinateValidation.test.ts` - 4 tests (coordinate mapping)

### What Works Right Now
- ‚úÖ 3D chess board renders with all 7 boards correctly positioned
- ‚úÖ All 32 pieces render in correct positions per piece_placement.json
- ‚úÖ Attack boards positioned ABOVE their main boards (correct Z-heights)
- ‚úÖ Camera controls (orbit, zoom) work smoothly
- ‚úÖ Piece selection highlights selected piece
- ‚úÖ Coordinate system validated via tests
- ‚úÖ **NEW: Complete move validation for all piece types**
- ‚úÖ **NEW: Legal move detection with Vertical Shadow blocking**
- ‚úÖ **NEW: Check and checkmate detection system**
- ‚úÖ **NEW: Illegal move prevention (can't leave own king in check)**
- ‚úÖ **NEW: Pinned piece handling**

### Known Issues / Limitations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No move execution yet (can select pieces and see valid moves, but can't actually make moves)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No turn management (both players can move any pieces)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No castling, en passant, or pawn promotion
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No move history or undo
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No UI indicators for check/checkmate status
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No game over screens or win/loss handling
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No game persistence
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Attack board piece movement not yet implemented (Phase 8)

## Critical Gotchas & Lessons Learned

### Phase 8 Specific

1. **Adjacency Must Include Cross-Line Connections**
   - Originally pinPositions.ts only had same-line adjacency
   - QL and KL boards must be able to move between lines
   - Fixed by adding cross-line connections to adjacentPins arrays
   - Example: QL1 adjacent to [QL2, KL1], not just [QL2]

2. **Knight Passengers Enable Multi-Level Jumps**
   - Standard rule: 0-2 levels on same line
   - With knight: 0-3 levels on same line
   - Implementation: Check passenger pieces for knight presence
   - Cross-line moves unaffected (always 1-level difference allowed)

3. **Vertical Shadow Requires Intermediate Level Checking**
   - Not just "is destination occupied?"
   - Must check EVERY level between source and destination
   - Exception: Knights ignore vertical shadow
   - Implementation: Loop through intermediate levels checking occupancy

4. **Board Rotation (180¬∞) Swaps Quadrants**
   - When rotate=true, pieces at corners swap positions
   - File offset: relativeFile ‚Üí (1 - relativeFile)
   - Rank offset: relativeRank ‚Üí (1 - relativeRank)
   - Critical for maintaining correct piece positions after rotation

5. **Camera Positioning Requires World Center Calculation**
   - Don't guess camera positions - calculate from world grid
   - World center = [(minX + maxX)/2, (minY + maxY)/2, (minZ + maxZ)/2]
   - Result: [5, 10, 6] for consistent targeting across all views

6. **Move History Must Support Board Moves**
   - Piece moves: "e2-e4" notation
   - Board moves: "WQL: QL1-QL3^180" notation
   - Need type field to distinguish: 'piece-move' vs 'board-move'
   - Future: Extend Move interface in gameStore

### General Architecture

7. **World Grid is Single Source of Truth**
   - Never calculate coordinates at render time
   - All positions stored in world grid from worldBuilder.ts
   - Rendering just reads coordinates, never computes them

8. **Test-Driven Development Works Well**
   - Writing tests first clarified validation rules
   - 20 tests for Phase 8 caught multiple edge cases early
   - Knight jump logic refined through test iterations

9. **Documentation Before Implementation**
   - Detailed IMPLIMENTATION_GUIDE.md saves time
   - User approval of plan before coding avoids rework
   - Reference documentation (ATTACK_BOARD_RULES.md) critical

## What Comes Next

### Phase 8: Move Execution & Special Moves (NEXT PRIORITY)
**Goal:** Implement move execution system and special moves.

**Tasks:**
1. **Move Execution System:**
   - Create `executeMove()` function to apply moves to game state
   - Update piece positions after valid moves
   - Handle piece captures
   - Integrate with `updateGameState()` to refresh check status
   - Switch turns after each move
   - Add move history tracking

2. **Special Moves:**
   - Castling (king + rook) - verify implementation needed for 3D chess
   - En passant (pawn capture) - if applicable in Raumschach
   - Pawn promotion when reaching opposite end
   - Attack board piece movement and repositioning

3. **UI Integration:**
   - Click-to-move interaction (click piece, click destination)
   - Visual feedback for selected piece and valid moves
   - Display current turn (whose turn it is)
   - Show captured pieces
   - Display check/checkmate status

**Key Files to Create:**
- `src/engine/gameController.ts` - Move execution logic
- `src/engine/validation/specialMoves.ts` - Castling, en passant, promotion
- `src/components/UI/GameStatus.tsx` - Display turn, check status, captured pieces
- `src/components/UI/MoveHistory.tsx` - Show move history

**Key Files to Modify:**
- `src/store/gameStore.ts` - Add move execution, turn switching, move history

**Reference:**
- See `reference_docs/meder-rules.md` for special move rules in 3D chess
- See `reference_docs/IMPLIMENTATION_GUIDE.md` Phase 8 for detailed specs

**Important Notes:**
- Check detection is already complete (Phase 7), so focus on move execution
- Attack board movement may have special rules - verify with meder-rules.md
- Must call `updateGameState()` after each move to refresh check status

### Phase 9: Game Flow & Polish

3. Export/import game notation
4. Optional: Online multiplayer via WebSockets
4. **Vertical Shadow (4 tests)**
   - 1-level moves (always allowed)
   - 2-level blocked by piece
   - 2-level allowed with knight
   - 3-level with knight

5. **Execution (4 tests)**
   - Basic board move
   - Passenger piece coordinates update

## Important Notes for Next Session

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Files - DO NOT MODIFY WITHOUT GOOD REASON
- `src/engine/world/pinPositions.ts` - Z-heights are correct; changes will break board positioning
- `src/engine/initialSetup.ts` - Piece placement matches piece_placement.json; keep in sync
- `src/engine/validation/pieceMovement.ts` - Movement rules validated by 18 tests; changes affect game logic
- `src/engine/validation/pathValidation.ts` - Vertical Shadow blocking is complex; well-tested
- `src/engine/validation/checkDetection.ts` - Check detection is core game logic; 15 tests validate it
- `reference_docs/piece_placement.json` - Source of truth for piece positions

### üîß When Making Changes
1. **Always run tests first:** `npm test`
2. **Always lint:** `npm run lint`
3. **Always build:** `npm run build`
4. **Always visually verify:** `npm run dev` and check in browser
5. **Stage specific files only:** `git add <specific-file>`, never `git add .`

- **Branch naming:** Use `devin/{timestamp}-{descriptive-slug}` for new branches
- **Latest commits:**
  - `9e91eae` - Phase 7: Check and checkmate detection system
  - `dad7f05` - Phase 6: Comprehensive move validation system

### üéØ Priority for Next Session
**FIRST: Create a new PR for Phases 6 & 7 changes**

The previous session completed Phases 6 & 7 but PR #2 was already merged. The changes are committed to branch `devin/1759778593-implement-phases-1-5` but need a new PR.

Steps:
1. Check current branch status: `git status`
2. Verify commits are present: `git log` (should see commits `9e91eae` and `dad7f05`)
3. Create new PR using `git_create_pr` with repo="wpettine/open_tri_dim_chess"
4. Wait for CI to pass using `git_pr_checks wait="True"`
5. Share PR link with user

**THEN: Start Phase 8: Move Execution & Special Moves**

Begin by reading:
1. `reference_docs/IMPLIMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - Phase 8 section
2. `reference_docs/meder-rules.md` - Official rules for special moves
3. Review existing code:
   - `src/engine/validation/checkDetection.ts` - Understand `updateGameState()` integration
   - `src/store/gameStore.ts` - Understand current state management
   - `src/engine/validation/moveValidator.ts` - Understand how moves are validated

Phase 8 is critical because:
- Move validation is complete but users can't actually make moves yet
- Need to implement click-to-move interaction
- Must integrate check detection with move execution
- Turn management is needed for actual gameplay

### üêõ Known Gotchas
1. **Attack board Z-heights:** Use `Z_MAIN + ATTACK_OFFSET`, not `Z_MAIN - ATTACK_OFFSET`
2. **File mapping:** File 'z' = 0, not 1; files are 0-indexed
3. **Level names:** piece_placement.json uses QL1/KL1/QL6/KL6, code uses WQL/WKL/BQL/BKL
4. **Coordinate consistency:** Always use fileToWorldX() and rankToWorldY(), never calculate directly
5. **Vertical Shadow Blocking:** When checking path clearance, must check ALL levels at intermediate (file, rank) coordinates, not just the path level
6. **Check Detection:** Always use `getLegalMovesAvoidingCheck()` for UI move highlighting, not `getLegalMoves()`
7. **Board-Level Coordinate Constraints:** White board has ranks 1-4, Neutral has 3-6, Black has 5-8 (overlapping ranges)
8. **Square ID Format:** Must match pattern `{file}{rank}{level}` (e.g., 'a1W', 'c3N', 'd8B')

### üìä Current Metrics
- **Lines of code:** ~12,000+ (including dependencies)
- **Components:** 7 React components
- **Test coverage:** 53 tests, all passing (5 test files)
- **Build time:** ~5-6 seconds
- **Dev server startup:** ~160ms
- **Validation modules:** 4 (moveValidator, pieceMovement, pathValidation, checkDetection)
**Implemented:**
- All user feedback incorporated into documentation
- Camera tilt angles specified exactly as requested
- Save/load game buttons added to move history component
- Radio button UI documented for rotation selection

## Session Continuity Notes

**For Next Agent/Session:**

1. **Current State:**
   - Phase 8 core mechanics (Steps 8.1-8.4) fully implemented and tested
   - Phase 8 documentation (Steps 8.5-8.6) fully expanded
   - Ready to implement visual rendering and UI components
   - All 58 tests passing, CI green

2. **Implementation Order:**
   - Start with Step 8.5 (camera system) - it's simpler
   - Then Step 8.6 (UI components) - more complex
   - Test visually after each component
   - Don't skip lint/test runs before commits

3. **Key Files to Create:**
   ```
   src/store/cameraStore.ts
   src/components/UI/CameraControls.tsx
   src/components/UI/CameraControls.css
   src/components/UI/MoveHistory.tsx
   src/components/UI/MoveHistory.css
   ```

4. **Key Files to Modify:**
   ```
   src/config/theme.ts (add cameraPresets)
   src/components/Board3D/Board3D.tsx (add CameraController)
   src/components/UI/BoardMovementPanel.tsx (add rotation radio buttons)
   src/components/UI/BoardMovementPanel.css (add rotation styles)
   src/App.tsx (integrate all UI components)
   ```

5. **Testing Checklist:**
   - [x] npm run lint passes
   - [x] npm test passes (all 58 tests)
   - [x] npm run dev starts successfully
   - [x] Camera presets work (smooth animations)
   - [x] Move history collapse/expand works
   - [x] Save game functionality implemented
   - [x] Load game functionality implemented
   - [x] New game with confirmation implemented
   - [ ] Attack board selection with rotation toggle (documented, not yet implemented)
   - [ ] UI responsiveness on small screens (future enhancement)

6. **Don't Forget:**
   - Install gsap if not present: `npm install gsap`
   - Test EVERY UI component in browser before moving on
   - Commit frequently with descriptive messages
   - Push to PR #3 branch (don't create new PR)
   - User wants to see visual testing screenshots if possible
