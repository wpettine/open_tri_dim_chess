# DEVIN_SCRATCH.md - Session Handoff Notes

**Last Updated:** October 7, 2025 - Session 3 (Expanding Phase 8 Documentation)
**Current Status:** Phase 8 (Attack Board Movement) - Core mechanics âœ…, Documentation expanded âœ…
**Test Status:** 58/58 tests passing (20 Phase 8 tests added)
**Next Priority:** Implement visual rendering and UI components (Steps 8.5-8.6)

---

## Quick Context

This is a 3D Chess implementation following the Meder rules for Tri-Dimensional Chess. The project uses React + TypeScript + Three.js for 3D rendering.

**Critical Design Principle:** The world grid is the single source of truth for all coordinates and positions. Never calculate coordinates at render time.

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Immediate: Implement Visual Rendering & UI (Steps 8.5-8.6)

**Step 8.5: Visual Rendering** (2-3 hours)
1. Install gsap: `npm install gsap` (if not already present)
2. Create `src/store/cameraStore.ts` with camera view state
3. Update `src/config/theme.ts` with cameraPresets configuration
4. Update `src/components/Board3D/Board3D.tsx` with CameraController
5. Test camera animations in browser at localhost:5173

**Step 8.6: UI Components** (3-4 hours)
1. Create `src/components/UI/CameraControls.tsx` + CSS
   - 4 buttons: Default, Top, Side, Front
   - Active state styling
2. Create `src/components/UI/MoveHistory.tsx` + CSS
   - Collapsible header with expand/collapse icon
   - Game controls: New Game, Save Game, Load Game buttons
   - Move list with color-coded entries
   - JSON save/load with validation
3. Update `src/components/UI/BoardMovementPanel.tsx` + CSS
   - Add rotation selector with radio buttons
   - Add selectedRotations state management
   - Disable execute button until rotation selected
4. Update `src/App.tsx` to integrate all components

**Step 8.8: Testing** (Already complete with 20 tests)

**Step 8.9: Verification Checklist**
- Go through full checklist in IMPLIMENTATION_GUIDE.md
- Ensure all Phase 8 features working end-to-end

## Key Architecture Notes

### Attack Board Movement System

**Validation Flow:**
1. User selects attack board â†’ `selectedBoardId` set in gameStore
2. UI displays legal moves â†’ calls `getLegalBoardMoves()` (to be implemented)
3. User selects destination + rotation
4. System validates via `validateBoardMove()` in worldMutation.ts:
   - âœ… Adjacency (with knight-aware multi-level support)
   - âœ… Occupancy (destination not blocked by another board)
   - âœ… Direction (forward/side/inverted rules)
   - âœ… Vertical Shadow (pieces blocking path unless knight present)
   - ðŸš§ King Safety (currently stub, needs Phase 7 integration)
5. If valid, execute via `executeBoardMove()`:
   - Update attackBoardPositions
   - Move all passenger pieces
   - Apply rotation if specified (180Â° swaps quadrants)

**Knight Jump Special Rule:**
- Normally boards can move 0-2 levels on same line
- With knight passenger, can move 0-3 levels on same line
- Cross-line moves (QLâ†”KL) always allowed if adjacent
- Implementation: `hasKnight` check in adjacency validation

**Vertical Shadow:**
- Non-knight pieces on passenger squares block multi-level moves
- Knight passenger allows board to "jump over" blocking pieces
- Implementation: Check each intermediate level for obstructions

### Camera System Design

**World Dimensions:**
- X: 2.1 to 8.4 (Files 1-4)
- Y: 2.1 to 18.9 (Ranks 1-9)
- Z: 0 to 12 (Levels 0-6, doubled for spacing)
- **World Center:** [5, 10, 6]

**Camera Presets:**
All target world center [5, 10, 6] with specific tilts:
- Default: [15, 15, 20] - Isometric starting view
- Top: [5, 10, 25] - Overhead with 15Â° tilt for piece visibility
- Side: [25, 10, 6] - Profile with 10Â° tilt to see board levels
- Front: [5, -10, 10] - Traditional chess view with 20Â° tilt

**Animation:**
- Using gsap for smooth 0.8s transitions with 'power2.out' easing
- Animates both camera.position and controls.target simultaneously
- OrbitControls remain enabled for manual adjustment after preset

### UI Component Architecture

**Layout Strategy:**
```
Top-Left: CameraControls (z-index: 101)
Top-Right: MoveHistory (z-index: 99) OR BoardMovementPanel (z-index: 100)
```

**State Management:**
- Camera: Zustand store `useCameraStore` (separate from game state)
- Game: Existing `useGameStore` extended with board selection
- Move History: Direct access to gameStore.moveHistory
- No prop drilling - each component subscribes to relevant store slices

**Collision Handling:**
- When both MoveHistory and BoardMovementPanel visible, they overlap
- BoardMovementPanel has higher z-index (100 vs 99)
- Future: Consider vertical stacking or sliding panels

## Critical Gotchas & Lessons Learned

### Phase 8 Specific

1. **Adjacency Must Include Cross-Line Connections**
   - Originally pinPositions.ts only had same-line adjacency
   - QL and KL boards must be able to move between lines
   - Fixed by adding cross-line connections to adjacentPins arrays
   - Example: QL1 adjacent to [QL2, KL1], not just [QL2]

2. **Knight Passengers Enable Multi-Level Jumps**
   - Standard rule: 0-2 levels on same line
   - With knight: 0-3 levels on same line
   - Implementation: Check passenger pieces for knight presence
   - Cross-line moves unaffected (always 1-level difference allowed)

3. **Vertical Shadow Requires Intermediate Level Checking**
   - Not just "is destination occupied?"
   - Must check EVERY level between source and destination
   - Exception: Knights ignore vertical shadow
   - Implementation: Loop through intermediate levels checking occupancy

4. **Board Rotation (180Â°) Swaps Quadrants**
   - When rotate=true, pieces at corners swap positions
   - File offset: relativeFile â†’ (1 - relativeFile)
   - Rank offset: relativeRank â†’ (1 - relativeRank)
   - Critical for maintaining correct piece positions after rotation

5. **Camera Positioning Requires World Center Calculation**
   - Don't guess camera positions - calculate from world grid
   - World center = [(minX + maxX)/2, (minY + maxY)/2, (minZ + maxZ)/2]
   - Result: [5, 10, 6] for consistent targeting across all views

6. **Move History Must Support Board Moves**
   - Piece moves: "e2-e4" notation
   - Board moves: "WQL: QL1-QL3^180" notation
   - Need type field to distinguish: 'piece-move' vs 'board-move'
   - Future: Extend Move interface in gameStore

### General Architecture

7. **World Grid is Single Source of Truth**
   - Never calculate coordinates at render time
   - All positions stored in world grid from worldBuilder.ts
   - Rendering just reads coordinates, never computes them

8. **Test-Driven Development Works Well**
   - Writing tests first clarified validation rules
   - 20 tests for Phase 8 caught multiple edge cases early
   - Knight jump logic refined through test iterations

9. **Documentation Before Implementation**
   - Detailed IMPLIMENTATION_GUIDE.md saves time
   - User approval of plan before coding avoids rework
   - Reference documentation (ATTACK_BOARD_RULES.md) critical

---

## Testing Strategy

### Phase 8 Test Coverage

**Created: boardMovement.test.ts (20 tests)**

1. **Adjacency Validation (7 tests)**
   - Same-line adjacency (2 levels apart)
   - Cross-line adjacency (QLâ†”KL)
   - Knight-enabled multi-level (3 levels with knight)
   - Invalid moves (too far, no knight)

2. **Occupancy Validation (2 tests)**
   - Destination occupied by another board
   - Destination free

3. **Direction Validation (3 tests)**
   - Forward moves (always allowed)
   - Sideways cross-line moves (allowed)
   - Backward moves (only from inverted pins)

4. **Vertical Shadow (4 tests)**
   - 1-level moves (always allowed)
   - 2-level blocked by piece
   - 2-level allowed with knight
   - 3-level with knight

5. **Execution (4 tests)**
   - Basic board move
   - Passenger piece coordinates update
   - Board rotation (180Â°)
   - Multiple pieces on rotating board

**Next Phase Tests Needed:**
- UI component rendering tests (React Testing Library)
- E2E tests for board movement + UI interaction
- Camera preset animation tests
- Save/load game validation tests
