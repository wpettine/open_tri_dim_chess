# Issue Fixed: React Three Fiber Compatibility

## Problem

**Error:** `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'S')`

**Cause:** Version mismatch between React and @react-three/fiber
- React 18.3.1 was installed
- @react-three/fiber 9.3.0 requires React 19
- This caused a runtime error in the reconciler

## Solution

Downgraded @react-three/fiber and @react-three/drei to versions compatible with React 18:

```bash
npm uninstall @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei
npm install --legacy-peer-deps @react-three/fiber@8.17.10 @react-three/drei@9.114.3
```

## Current Working Versions

```json
{
  "@react-three/fiber": "^8.17.10",  // Compatible with React 18
  "@react-three/drei": "^9.114.3",   // Compatible with React 18
  "react": "^18.3.1",
  "react-dom": "^18.3.1"
}
```

## Verification

✅ **Build:** Success
✅ **Tests:** 20/20 passing
✅ **Dev Server:** Running at http://localhost:5173/
✅ **Runtime:** No errors

## What You Should See Now

Open http://localhost:5173/ and you should see:

1. ✅ 7 colored board platforms (3 brown main, 4 orange attack)
2. ✅ All squares rendered in checkerboard pattern
3. ✅ 40 chess pieces with geometric shapes
4. ✅ Interactive 3D camera controls working
5. ✅ Console logs showing coordinate validation data
6. ✅ No errors in browser console

## Future Upgrade Path

When you want to upgrade to React 19 in the future:

```bash
npm install react@19 react-dom@19
npm install @react-three/fiber@latest @react-three/drei@latest
```

But for now, React 18 + R3F 8.17 is stable and fully functional.

**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Application now runs without errors!
