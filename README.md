# Open Tri-Dimensional Chess

A web-based implementation of 3D Chess (Tri-Dimensional Chess) based on the Meder rules, built with React, TypeScript, Three.js, and Vite.

## About

This project implements a fully functional 3D chess game with:
- **3D board visualization** using Three.js
- **Complete rule validation** for piece movements across multiple levels
- **Attack board movement** system with passenger piece handling
- **Path validation** including vertical shadow constraints
- **Check and checkmate detection** (in progress)

The game follows the Meder rules for Tri-Dimensional Chess, featuring a main board with 64 squares across three levels and four movable attack boards that can transport pieces between different positions in 3D space.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v20.19+ (required for Vite 7 and @vitejs/plugin-react 5)
- npm or pnpm
### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/wpettine/open_tri_dim_chess.git
cd open_tri_dim_chess

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Running the Game

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The game will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or the next available port). The development server supports hot module reloading, so changes will be reflected automatically.

### Running Tests

Run all tests:

```bash
npm test
```

Run tests in watch mode:

```bash
npm test -- --watch
```

Run a specific test file:

```bash
npm test -- boardMovement.test.ts
```

### Code Quality

Lint the codebase:

```bash
npm run lint
```

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```
